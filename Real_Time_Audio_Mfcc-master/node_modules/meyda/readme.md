Meyda is a Javascript audio feature extraction library. Meyda supports both offline feature extraction as well as real-time feature extraction using the [Web Audio API](https://github.com/WebAudio/web-audio-api "Web Audio API"). We wrote a paper about it, which is available [here](http://doc.gold.ac.uk/~mu202hr/publications/RawlinsonSegalFiala_WAC2015.pdf).
